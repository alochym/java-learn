# JUNIT TEST

- JUnit is a program that can be used to perform unit testing of software by writing test cases in Java.
- A common use for JUnit is to create a set of unit tests that can be run automatically when changes are made to software.
-  There is even a method of development known as [test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) that advocates writing unit tests even before writing the software under test itself.
- Common terms that you may encounter when reading about JUnit include:
  - **Test method**: a method in a Java class that contains a single unit test.
  - **Test class**: a Java class containing one or more test methods.
  - **Assertion**: a statement that you include in a test method to check that the results of a test are as expected.
  - **Test fixture**: a class that is used to set up state for multiple tests; typically used when the set up routines are "expensive" or take a long time to execute.
  - **Test suite**: a grouping of test classes that are run together.
